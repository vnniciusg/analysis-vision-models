# Analysis Vision Models

This project demonstrates how to use vision models to extract text from images, inspired by [Faster Chart Analysis with SmolVLM Automation](https://codecut.ai/faster-chart-analysis-smolvlm-automation/).

## Overview

The main goal is to understand and implement techniques for extracting textual information from images using modern vision models. This can be useful for automating chart analysis, document processing, and other computer vision tasks.

## Features

- Load images and process them with a vision model.
- Extract text from images using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) or vision-language models.
- Simple and extensible code structure for experimentation.
